# Custom Killer Voices

This is a modified version of Killer Voices 3.0.15 with a template for creating custom announcers for Fortnite. 
If you would like to create your own custom announcer pack, follow the template located in `/js/custom voice pack template.js` and add your changes to `/js/vp-db.js`. If you're not sure how to do this, just look at how I did it with Ethan in `vp-db.js` and it should be pretty easy to figure out. 
**NOTE:** Make sure you include a custom **.webp** image in `/img/voice-packs/` with the same name as your Custom VoicePacks Folder Name. If you need to convert an image to **.webp** [you can do so super easily here.](https://ezgif.com/jpg-to-webp)
